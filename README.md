Customer Management System     

This Project Was Intented to **Refresh My Knowledge about OOP** and To learn **Basics of unit Testing**:
Here i applied the following:

1) Abstraction : By Seprating the solution into different projects that each one do something
2) encapsulation : By using diffrenet access modifiers in each project to make every thing encapsulated so that their is no need to know every thing about a certain class unless I am using it
3) Inheritance : By Creating a base class that can be extended by other classes
4) Polymorphism : By Overriding methods in the base class 
their is 2 diffrenet types of it 

- Inheritance-based : when overriding a method from the base class in the child class
- Interface-based : when implementing a method from the interface in the class that implements it's methods
